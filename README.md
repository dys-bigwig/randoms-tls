Started out as a file to keep solutions for various books like "The Little Schemer" and "Scheme and the Art of Programming" but now it's just a scratchpad of various functions I thought were interesting or popped into my head.

If you stumbled upon this by chance (or boredom), hopefully you find something useful or interesting :)
